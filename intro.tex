{\large \bf Introduction:}

I had the fortunate opportunity to pursue my graduate studies at UC Berkeley under the direction of Tarek Zohdi. Throughout my time, I was exposed to a handful of useful tools from applied mathematics, machine learning, optimization, and high performance computing. This document is an attempt to transcribe and compile my notes from a 5-year period into a reference guide for myself.

The intended audience was myself. That being said, I have shared sections of this document with colleagues and friends who claimed it was helpful in their studies. Maybe it will be helpful to you. 

This is a live document that I intend to continue to update, which means there are likely to be some errors. If you find mistakes and feel like telling me, I will be grateful and happy to hear from you, even for the most trivial of errors.
